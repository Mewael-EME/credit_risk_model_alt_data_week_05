# üìä Credit Risk Probability Model Leveraging Alternative Data

## üß† Business Context and Rationale for Credit Scoring

### 1. Basel II Accord and the Need for Interpretability

The **Basel II Capital Accord** mandates that financial institutions adopt risk-sensitive frameworks to effectively measure and manage **credit exposures**. A central requirement of this framework is that credit risk models must be **interpretable, transparent, and justifiable** to both regulators and business stakeholders ([World Bank, 2020](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/935891585869698451-0130022020/original/CREDITSCORINGAPPROACHESGUIDELINESFINALWEB.pdf)). Institutions are expected to demonstrate that their credit decisions are grounded in **empirical evidence** and that **model outcomes are aligned with individual risk profiles**.

Thus, for a model to be regulatory-compliant, it must go beyond predictive power ‚Äî it should be:
- **Auditable**, with a clear trail from input features to predictions.
- **Understandable**, even to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Fair and explainable**, especially when alternative data is involved.

This aligns with the principles of **model governance and accountability** as emphasized in the HKMA report on alternative credit scoring ([HKMA, 2019](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-functions/financial-infrastructure/alternative_credit_scoring.pdf)).

### 2. Use of Proxy Variables in the Absence of Labeled Defaults

Given the absence of an explicit ‚Äúdefault‚Äù label in our dataset, we introduce a **proxy variable** ‚Äî `is_high_risk` ‚Äî by leveraging **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** behavior segmentation. Clustering techniques like K-Means help categorize customer behavior patterns, inferring risk levels based on inactivity or low engagement.

While practical, this proxy method introduces **critical risks**:
- **Label noise**: Customers with low activity but strong repayment behavior may be wrongly classified ([Risk Officer, 2020](https://www.risk-officer.com/Credit_Risk.htm)).
- **Behavioral bias**: Clustering may detect patterns unrelated to actual creditworthiness.
- **Unintended consequences**: Penalizing infrequent users can reduce financial inclusion and contradict the objective of expanding credit access ([World Bank, 2020](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/935891585869698451-0130022020/original/CREDITSCORINGAPPROACHESGUIDELINESFINALWEB.pdf)).

Therefore, proxy-based labels must undergo **rigorous validation**, including consultation with domain experts and iterative refinement through stakeholder feedback ([Statistica Sinica, 2018](https://www3.stat.sinica.edu.tw/statistica/oldpdf/A28n535.pdf)).

### 3. Balancing Model Complexity and Interpretability

In a tightly regulated domain like finance, there‚Äôs a delicate **trade-off between model interpretability and predictive performance** ([CFI, 2023](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/commercial-lending/credit-risk/)). While simple models such as **Logistic Regression with Weight of Evidence (WoE)** transformations are preferred for their transparency, they may miss complex nonlinearities in behavior. Conversely, **advanced models** like Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) offer superior accuracy but suffer from low explainability.

| Interpretable Models (e.g., Logistic + WoE) | Black-Box Models (e.g., GBM, XGBoost)       |
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| ‚úÖ Easily explainable to auditors            | ‚úÖ Capture intricate patterns and interactions |
| ‚úÖ Transparent decision boundaries           | ‚ùå Require post-hoc explanation tools (e.g., SHAP, LIME) |
| ‚úÖ Aligned with regulatory expectations      | ‚ùå Risk of regulatory rejection if not interpretable |
| ‚ùå Might underfit complex behaviors          | ‚úÖ More adaptive to alternative data signals |

To address this, a **hybrid modeling strategy** is employed: interpretable models serve as a **baseline for risk governance**, while complex models enhance **predictive strength** ‚Äî supplemented with modern **explainability frameworks** like SHAP or LIME for post-hoc interpretation ([Towards Data Science, 2020](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-develop-a-credit-risk-model-and-scorecard-91335fc01f03)).

### ‚úÖ Conclusion

The design of our credit risk scoring system integrates **data science innovation** with **risk governance principles**. Using alternative behavioral data sources requires balancing **accuracy**, **fairness**, and **explainability**. Our strategy ensures:
- Regulatory alignment under Basel II.
- Justified use of proxy variables with caution.
- A multi-model approach that maximizes performance without compromising interpretability.

By doing so, the model supports both **business scalability** and **responsible lending practices**, aligning with global credit risk management standards ([World Bank, 2020](https://thedocs.worldbank.org/en/doc/935891585869698451-0130022020/original/CREDITSCORINGAPPROACHESGUIDELINESFINALWEB.pdf); [HKMA, 2019](https://www.hkma.gov.hk/media/eng/doc/key-functions/financial-infrastructure/alternative_credit_scoring.pdf); [Risk Officer, 2020](https://www.risk-officer.com/Credit_Risk.htm)).
